To compile and install dim properly on macosx>10.10

download dim (http://dim.web.cern.ch)
extract to a "dim" folder using unzip -a

copy content of dim4mac folder into dim (cp path/to/dim4mac/* /path/to/dim)
cd dim
tcsh
source setupMac.sh ( same procedure as setup.sh + Apply few patches to compile with clang and build shared libraries for mac)
make all

if you encounter this error when compiling did: 
	"./src/did/did.h:1:10: fatal error: 'Mrm/MrmAppl.h' file not found"
Check if OpenMotif is installed in /usr/OpenMotif
If itâ€™s not change MOTIFINC and MOTIFLIB variables in makefile_did accordingly
if using macport:
	MOTIFINC = /opt/local/include
	MOTIFLIB = /opt/local/lib
